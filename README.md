# Pac-Man with AI Ghosts

This project is a Python implementation of the classic Pac-Man game, featuring AI-controlled ghosts using different pathfinding algorithms. The maze is generated procedurally using a genetic algorithm for variety and challenge.

## Features

- **Procedural Maze Generation:** Each game uses a new maze generated by a genetic algorithm.
- **Customizable Maze Fitness:** You can tinker with the fitness function in the maze generator to influence the type of maze produced (e.g., more open, more walls, longer paths, etc.).
  - The fitness function in `maze.py` combines two main factors:
    - **Wall Score:** Controls how open or closed the maze is. A higher wall score (by increasing its weight) will produce more open mazes with fewer walls. Lowering it will create denser, more challenging mazes.
    - **Path Score:** Controls the average path length between corners. Increasing its weight will favor mazes with longer, more winding paths, while lowering it will result in more direct, shorter paths.
  - Example (from `maze.py`):
    ```python
    return wall_score * 0.9 + path_score * 0.1
    ```
    - Increase `wall_score` weight (e.g., `0.95`) for more open mazes.
    - Increase `path_score` weight (e.g., `0.5`) for longer, more complex paths.
    - Adjust both to balance openness and path complexity as desired.
- **AI Ghosts:** Four ghosts use different algorithms to chase Pac-Man:
  - Blinky: A\* Search
  - Inky: Dijkstra's Algorithm
  - Pinky: Breadth-First Search (BFS)
  - Clyde: Greedy Search
- **Power Pellets:** Eat power pellets to turn ghosts blue and eat them for extra points.
- **HUD:** Displays score, lives, and power-up timer.
- **Visualization:** Optionally visualize ghost pathfinding and maze generation.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/) library

## Installation

1. Install Python 3.x from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
2. Install pygame:
   ```
   pip install pygame
   ```
3. Ensure the following directory structure (with art assets in `pacman-art`):

   ```
   AI Project (PAC-MAN)/
   ├── main.py
   ├── pacman.py
   ├── ghost.py
   ├── maze.py
   ├── utils.py
   ├── pacman-art/
   │   ├── pacman-right/
   │   ├── ghosts/
   │   └── other/
   └── README.md
   ```

## How to Run

1. Open a terminal in the project directory.
2. Run the game:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

## Controls

- Arrow keys: Move Pac-Man
- R: Restart after game over/win
- Q or ESC: Quit

## Customization

- To show ghost pathfinding or maze generation, edit the following variables in `main.py`:
  ```python
  SHOW_GHOST_PATHS = True
  SHOW_GENERATIONS = False
  ```
